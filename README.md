## Development Process
1. **Design Phase**: Created wireframes in Figma focusing on video showcasing, after feedback from proffesor. I've decide to change the design to white and make it to one page as it's easier to code and don't have much work to showcase.
2. **Implementation**: 
   - Used Bootstrap 5 for responsive layout
   - Added Animate.css for subtle animations
   - Optimized all images with `picture` tag
3. **Challenges**:
   - Video grid responsiveness - Solved with Bootstrap's grid system
   - Color contrast for accessibility - Adjusted with WCAG contrast checker

## Technical Specifications
- **Frameworks**: Bootstrap 5, Animate.css
- **Fonts**: Poppins (Google Fonts), Font Awesome
- **Optimizations**:
  - Lazy loading for images/videos
  - Compressed assets (videos under 5MB each)
  - Semantic HTML with ARIA labels

## Assets Used
- All videos and images are original content
- Icons from Font Awesome (v6.4.2)
- Google Fonts (Poppins)
- Logo Icons from their companies
